		<h2>FAQ<h2/>
		<h3><p>Q- Why is the "brand" called celest and why are there 2 products called celest??</p>
		<p>A- It is mostly like this because i want to expand celest and every directly celest owned product is likely going to be named "Celest" That way people know what celest is!</p>
		<p>Q- Why does the website look like this? </p>
		<p>A- Mostly because i dont know how to use CSS And the reason why im not just using a website provider is because, Our clients are providing off of us! If we use a provider are they realy providing off of us? Or are they getting provided by the provider? </p> </h3>
